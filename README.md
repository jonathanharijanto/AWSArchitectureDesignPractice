# AWS: Architecture Design Practice

## (Theoretical) Problem
A small start-up company is considering to adopt AWS. Their current architecture is a classic n-tier Web application running on infrastructure within their traditional corporate data center. Their app supports bulk updates of customer information on a regular basis. The start-up is about to kick off a massive marketing campaign and is confident that they will experience significant, rapid growth in the next couple of months. The CTO and senior architecture team engaged you to provide architectural recommendations in the following areas:

* How to scale their application to meet demand
* How to address the lack of Disaster Recovery
* Effective distribution of load
* How to architect for shared content storage, given the increased performance demands of the application
* Latency of content served directly from S3 or storage attached to EC2
* A self-healing infrastructure that recovers from failed service instances
* Security of data at rest and in transit
* How to manage the ingestion of increased customer updates on AWS cost-effectively
* How to connect their existing data center to the application on AWS, and then integrate this architecture with current management systems

## Objective
Recommend a scalable, elastic, and redundant architecture that allows the start-up to grow organically. The architecture should specifically address the requirements/concerns as described above with a description of any assumptions made to determine the best solution.
